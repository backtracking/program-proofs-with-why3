This repository contains some programs from Rustan Leino's book
"Program Proofs" verified with Why3.

Author: Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre (CNRS)

Rustan Leino's book "Program Proofs" is an introduction to program
verification using the programming language
[Dafny](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny) and its program verifier.
[Why3](http://why3.lri.fr/) is another tool for deductive program
verification, with its own programming language, WhyML, and its
program verifier.

This repository follows the structure of Rustan's book, with one
subdirectory per chapter. When relevant, source files contains
comments about the differences between Dafny and Why3.
